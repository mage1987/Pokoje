<h2>A programing learning project.</h2>

<p>
What I want to achieve:
  <ul>
    <li>Make a fun scary story.</li>
    <li>Make it into a simple text based game, where the player user simple iterface to navigate through the game</li>
    <li>Learn some programing basics in the process</li>
    <li>Refresh the html and css skills I once had</li>
    <li>Finish the story and hence the game</li>
    <li>Give it to someone to play it</li>
  </ul>
</p>

What a skilful and clever boy.\" <br> There was a short silence and you thought The Voice kinda smiled and blinked, or something.<br> \"So let's play some more. What you say? It was pretty easy with those prepared buttons and all, right? Let's make it little harder. I'm giving you The Command Line. Yeah man, that field right in front of you. Enjoy, dude!<br>What da hell? You thougth. Somebody is shiting me, right? What am I supposed to do with that? Am I in a computer game? You remembered one of your first computers and the crude UI it had back then. Or better to say it didn't have. You looked around yourself. There is literally nothing around you, just white everywhere, endless. And obviously, The Command Line floating in the midair with big Execute! button and something like keyboard.<br>Alright, let's try it. What was the command to get some help in that ancient computer of yours...? \" "; // nápis na první obrazovce, welcome pokoje

  "Yes. \"Friend\", \"Mellon\" in Quenya, is the word that opened the Mines of Moria when Gandalf said it.

Maybe you'll find out...\" <p> You woke up in a fairly large, badly lit room. An old, weak bulb is hanging on a wire from the ceeling. The corners of the room are not lit at all and it seems something creeps in the shadows there, watching you. The floor creaks with every step you take. <p>How you got here? No, you can't recall, no matter how much you try. Your head aches teribly, but you don't think you have been drinking. Or have you?<p>You better get out quickly. What you gonna do, Michael?";
